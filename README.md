# Python-for-Data-Science-Project
In this project, revenue and stock price data for Tesla and Gamestop were extracted via yf package and webscraping, to compare the price of the stock vs the revenue. The dashboard will not only provide information about the revenue and stock price, but will allow us to see if there is a correlation between the two.
